## Beep (also known as Link)

This project was an idea for a hardware hackathon that my friends and I came up with. We paired a bluetooth beacon to phones and created a social network out of it. The bluetooth beacons were made as rings so that the user can keep it on them at all times while looking fashionable. 

## Features of this project
We took apart an [Estimote iBeacon](http://estimote.com), and set the UUIDs of all the devices to be unique from other devices so that we could only come in contact with the ones we want

1. Estimote iBeacon
 * took apart and re-soldered the connections to make the device smaller
2. Software to connect the user to the beacon
 * embedded social network into the app
3. Our team won best pitch at the event. All the information to our project is availible at [www.hackster.io/Link](http://www.hackster.io/387/link?offset=13&ref=event&ref_id=353)
	
### Notes
The actual matching algorithm was hardcoded for the demo (due to time constraints of the hackathon, I didn't want to set up any backend), but this can all be easily changed to actually match people based on the information teathered to their beacon.
