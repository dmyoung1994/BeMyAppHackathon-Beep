# Beep (also known as Link)

This project was an idea for a hardware hackathon that my friends and I came up with. We paired a bluetooth beacon to phones and created a social network out of it. The bluetooth beacons were made as rings so that the user can keep it on them at all times while looking fashionable. 

## Features of this project
We took apart an estimote iBeacon, and set the UUIDs of all the devices to be unique from other devices so that we could only come in contact with the ones we want

1. Estimote iBeacon

	*took apart and resoldered the connections to make the device smaller
	
	
2. Software to connect the user to the beacon

	* embedded social network into the app
	
## Note
The actual matching algorithm was hardcoded for the demo (due to time constraints of the hackathon, I didn't want to set up any backend), but this can all be easily changed to actually match people based on the information teathered to their beacon.
